# MorseCodeTranslator
A simple morse -> english/ english -> morse translator written in vanilla JavaScript that is able to detect which is being inputed and translated it to the other. 
It is able to translate letters, numerals, and special characters. 


Extra To Do: 
  - change the switch statments into objects,
  - change the delimiter for morse chars to / instead of tripple space
  - write the single function to do the translation between morse to english and english to morse
